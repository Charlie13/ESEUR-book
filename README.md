If you know of any software engineering data that you think should be included, please let me know.

The current draft (0.5.0) contains the Human cognitive characteristics chapter, plus second half of the book covering analysis of software engineering data.  Material on the first half, which discusses what is empirically known about software engineering will be added as each chapter reaches a stable state.

0.5.0 Jan 17 Human cognitive characteristics chapter, plus minor changes to earlier released material.

0.4.0 Oct 16 Statistical techniques for analysing software engineering data.
