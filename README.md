The Github repo for issues involving the book "Empirical Software Engineering using R" by Derek M. Jones.

[Blog post](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2012/06/22/background-to-my-book-project-empirical-software-engineering-with-r/) giving some background on the book.

[Plots of the data post](http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/index.html).

If you know of any software engineering data that you think should be included, please let me know.

The current draft (0.4.0) contains the second half of the book covering analysis of software engineering data.  Material on the first half, which discusses what is empirically known about software engineering will be added as each  chapter reaches a stable state.
